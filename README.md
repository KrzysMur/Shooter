# Shooter

Requirements:
  -OpenCV Python
  -ConfigParser Python
  -Webcam
  
The program runs by running main.py file. You can close the program by closing a terminal that opens with the program (Ctrl+C).
The program currently supports only 10m air pistol target. 

ISSUES:

If the program cannot access your webcam open a config.ini file and change "cam" setting. It should either be 0 or 1 depending on how many webcams you have connected to your PC.
